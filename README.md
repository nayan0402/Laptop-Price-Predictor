# Laptop Price Prediction Model

Hey there! Welcome to my Laptop Price Predictor project! This is a fun machine learning project I worked on to predict how much a laptop should cost based on its specs like the brand, processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, and more. It's all done in a Jupyter Notebook, so you can see everything step by step.



## Project Description

In this project, I built a model to guess laptop prices using a bunch of cool machine learning techniques. Hereâ€™s what I did:

1. Data Collection: I got a dataset with lots of laptop specs and their prices.
2. Data Cleaning: I fixed missing values, turned text data into numbers, and scaled the numerical data.
3. Model Training: Tried out different models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to see which one works best.
4. Model Evaluation: Checked how well the models worked using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
5. Predictions: Made predictions on laptop prices and compared them to the actual prices to see how accurate the model is.

This notebook walks you through all the steps, so you can see exactly how I built the model. Feel free to play around with the code, try out different techniques, and see how it changes the predictions
